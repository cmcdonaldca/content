                       <h3>Why Closures?</h3>
                       <ul>
                         <li>Common in JavaScript.</li>
                         <li>Node.JS callbacks.</li>
                         <li>Some practical uses.</li>

                    <h2>The Simplest Closure</h2>
                    <pre><code data-trim contenteditable>

    var x = 1;
    function foo() {
      return x;

                <blockquote style="color: white; background: rgba(0,0,0,0.4);">
		<p>
		A man goes on a long trip. Before leaving, he takes a snapshot
                of his house. 
                <p>
                While he's away, the house is replaced with a 
                condo. The man is unaware and continues to show the photo and 
                describe his house to the people he meets.

                    <h3>The Traveller code example</h3>
                    <pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
&nbsp;
    var color = 'white';

    function leaveHome () {
       // a variable in leaveHome's scope
       var description = "My house is " + color;
       // returns another function, creating a closure over description
       return function() {
          console.log(description);
       }
    }

    var travellingMan = leaveHome();
    travellingMan(); // "My house is white"
    color = 'red';   // They painted the house
    travellingMan(); // "My house is white"

                    <h3>Things to Notice</h3>
                    <ol>
		      <li>In Javascript, functions are objects, too.</li>
                      <li>Functions can create and return other functions.</li>
                      <li>Functions can be anonymous.</li>
		      <li>The returned function "closes over" the variables in
                          the scope where it was created, forming a closure.</li>
                    </ol>
                </section>
                <section>
                   <h3>More examples</h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li>An "inner function" is a closure.</li>
                      <li>Functions that get returned are closures.</li>
                      <li>Functions that get passed (ie. callbacks) are closures.</li>
                      <li>Any function that accesses variables outside it's immediate lexical scope is a closure.</li>
                    </ul>
